## 📝  Summary:
Hello, I am ***Dennise Tohpati***,

After earning a BEng in Aerospace Engineering from Queen's University, I currently serve as a Research and Development Engineer at Blow Moulding Technologies. My daily responsibilities entail mechatronics, research, and design optimization (please refer to my resume for further information).

While I'm relatively new to the world of programming, I've devoted a significant amount of interest and time to honing my skills in this field. My programming philosophy centers on comprehending the fundamentals of how the code I've written functions at a lower level, thereby enabling me to exercise more control and streamline optimization.

I firmly believe that innovation stems from curiosity and collaboration. If you're interested in collaborating with me on any projects, please don't hesitate to contact me via the contact section.

## 🔎 Fun Facts about me:
<p>Something that might break the ice; </p>
    - I like Blue/Black (typical), most of my clothing and accesories are blue. <br>
    - I prefer UNIX kernel for my daily driver, however i still use Windows for my work. <br>
    - I started programming when i was in high-school with VBA, moved on to MATLAB when i was in the University, and Python for daily use. <br>
    - Just recently converted from Neovim to Emacs with Evil mode, and I am loving it! <br>

## 💻  What powers my setup:
<p>Technically, i do anything from data science to software engineering as part of my daily work (beside research and design) and these are things i use regularly:</p>

<p>PS: There are no badges for this, but i also use LabVIEW for hardware control and data acquisition (work in a lab makes you use this, and trust me they're awesome) and MATLAB </p>
