```

## 📝  Summary:
Hello, I am ***Dennise Tohpati***,

I graduated from Queen's University with BEng in Aerospace Engineering, and currently working as a Reseach and Development (R&D) Engineer at Blow Moulding Technologies. My daily work focuses on research, mechatronics, and design optimisation (please check my resume for more detail). 

I am relatively new in the programming world, and have taken a huge amount interest and time in developing my skill in this area. My philosophy in programming is **<em>understanding the fundamental</em>** on how a code that i wrote works in a lower-level; hence, allows me to have more controll and easy to optimise. 

I am a core believer where curiosity and collaboration are core values which brings innovations! If you'd like to collaborate in any projects with me, please hit me up from contact section.

## 🔎 Fun Facts about me:
<p>Something that might break the ice; </p>
    - I like Blue/Black (typical), most of my clothing and accesories are blue. <br>
    - I prefer UNIX kernel for my daily driver, however i still use Windows for my work. <br>
    - I started programming when i was in high-school with VBA, moved on to MATLAB when i was in the University, and Python for daily use. <br>
    - Just recently converted from Neovim to Emacs with Evil mode, and I am loving it! <br>

<p>I am still expanding my knowledge in programming!</p>

## 💻  What powers my setup:
<p>Technically, i do anything from data science to software engineering as part of my daily work (beside research and design) and these are things i use regularly:</p>

<p>PS: There are no badges for this, but i also use LabVIEW for hardware control and data acquisition (work in a lab makes you use this, and trust me they're awesome) and MATLAB </p>
